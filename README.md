# Lab | Reading About Statistic Concepts

In the future, you will need to understand deep statistical concepts by reading technical articles. As a training for that, it is interesting to start from here. Also, as we have limited time, this is a way to have some self guided learning to understand everything better and have a wider knowledge.

This week you will find some questions here that you will need to answer by documentating yourself. So you will do a different PR for each question (you are meant to answer the questions in different days). Don't hesitate to write as many text as you need and push images if you need them.

Remember for this lab: there is a right answer. But there is no perfect way to explain it (except for in a mathematical way, but this is another story).

## Challenge 1: What is the difference between expected value and mean?
You know both concepts but, is there a difference? Are they synonims? Start investigating. 

As a good reference (once you have looked for some information) you have   [this](http://expected.news/value2) article.

## Challenge 2: What is the "problem" in science with p-values?
We have told you that a lot of scientifical investigations are based on p-values. The last week, Nature magazine published [an article](http://nature.social/statistical4) regarding the problem. Start digging on it!

Don't hesitate to use more articles if you want to :)


## Solution 1
The expected value is the sum of all the outcomes of a random variable multiplied by it's probability. It gives an overall view of if the total outcome is positive, negative or neutral.

On the other hand, the mean is just a random variable than gives a descriptive statistic describing the central value of a sample/population/... of RV.

## Solution 2
Talking about statistical significance doesn't make sense, because you are building all your tests on a sample not the whole population. P value is just one of many things to consider and we should all understand that what we are trying to do is REJECT THE FALSE HYPOTHESIS, not accept ours.
